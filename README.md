This is a windows C++ library, which is used to make desktop programs.

# Background

In the past, I used MFC to develop desktop applications, but MFC had some trouble. We need to do a lot of work. In character conversion, there is no good multilingual solution, and can not display PNG images well, and so on.

So I made a simple library in my free time, it does not depend on MFC, and is smaller.
